HarmonicHaven E-Commerce Website was created using React. Template design downloaded from Frontend Mentor as a pro subscription.
Fews of the technologies used for this Project are:

1. The React Hook Form: The React Hook form is one of the library used for this project. React Hook Forms basically helps with validations and avoid controlled input. Validations are done onTrigger, either text change, tab change, onchange itself. This is really a great tool as it helps in developing the projec more faster.

2. Pretty-Checkbox: The Pretty checkbox is a css file downloaded from dev's github account. As we all know, it somehow hard to style native radio buttons including checboxes. so this library was used as well to style radio buttons used in the project

3. The project integrates with a brobus backend built using Golang and PostgreSQL
   
React hooks used are
  1. useState
  2. useEffect
  3. useContext: managing data globally. equivalent to the redux when joined with the useReducer hooks
  4. useHistory,Link coming from react-router-dom library
  5. json data used locally

3. Animate on scroll was not also excluded as it was used to animate contents in the applications.
